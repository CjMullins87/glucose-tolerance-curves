# Diabetic Remission Is Not A Function of Glucose Tolerance

* The current definition is an A1C below 6.5 without antidiabetic medications
* This can be achieved through adhering to strict lifestyle practices such as 
low carb or no carb diets
* This definition allows non-medical professionals to coopt the language of medicine to 
promote and sell non-medicines
* Giving credibility to these actors sows distrust in medicine and the ability
of practitioners to manage diabetes

# T2D Remission Should Focus on Solutions that Center Glucose Tolerance

* This excludes non-medical professionals and better protects the walled garden of
credibility and expertise
* While medicine adopts definitions and therapies that center
lifestyle, medicine will always have to battle malicious actors for legitimacy
and patient needs will go unmet
* This also re-centers the issue at the hart of diabetes, which is glucose intolerance
* This means there should be interest not just in A1C, but also AUC values related
to the standardized OGTT

# CGMs Should Define T2D Management

* CGMs are increasingly accessible to patients and professionals, and provide
unprecedentedly accurate and high resolution blood glucose data
* With access to this data, patients can make informed decisions about their diet
and lifestyle, and practitioners can better see opportunities for medication to
improve glycemic control
* Most importantly, practitioners can administer a standard OGTT and get high resolution
outcomes to assess glucose tolerance and - potentially - phenotype drivers of insulin
resistance, allowing more targeted therapy
